convection_sim
==============

A simulation of convection within the solar convection zone. The code is written in IDL and is dependent on the SSW IDL code repository.

This repository contains a directory of IDL code attempting to perform the simulation, and is incomplete.

The Python directory contains code written by Sean Blake and used for his 4th year Physics/Astro project at TCD.
-See the README.md file in the Python directory.
