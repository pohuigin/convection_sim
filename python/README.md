This directory contains:

-The code convect.py
-A data file called bleh.txt
-A pdf with all of my plots, and the locations of the plots in my code.
-A few other text files containing data. These are the secondary data files, and aren't strictly necessary for all the plots, just the temperature gradients one.

I'm not sure how familiar you are with Python, so here is how to get the code running:  I use "Ipython" which is some sort of python suite. I'm told it's very good.

Put all of the files in the same folder as convect.py. Navigate to this folder using the terminal. Open Ipython in the terminal (type "ipython --pylab"). Type "run -i convect.py" to run the code.
I have explained how to get the different plots in the attached PDF (readme.pdf).
