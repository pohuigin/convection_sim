solar_model
===========

The file ../python/bleh.txt is the (main) source data used. It was a bit complicated to extract, but this is done in the first few lines of the code.
It is also on http://users-phys.au.dk/jcd/solar_models/fgong.l5bi.d.15c
The instructions for it are here: http://users-phys.au.dk/jcd/solar_models/file-format.pdf

bp2004stdmodel.txt is auxiliary data, and may be used for comparison.

From Mark Miesch:
"Regarding static models of the convection zone, the one that is
commonly used in the community is "Model S", by Jorgen
Christensen-Dalsgaard, available here:

http://users-phys.au.dk/jcd/solar_models/

Maybe you know about this already.  For the deep convection zone
(r < 0.98), a hydrostatic, adiabatic polytrope works remarkably well.
However, super granulation is close enough to the surface that
something like Model S (which takes into account more complex
equations of state, superadiabaticity, latent heat transfer, etc)
is a better bet."
